# sandpile-criticality

Imagine a literal sandpile. As we add grains to the middle of the pile, the slope of the pile will eventually reach a maximum slope, at which a point an avalanche the size of the entire pile relaxes the pile into the so called angle of repose â€“ the instability. While the slope of the pile moves from the angle of repose to the maximum slope, small avalanches can be seen to occur which follow a power law distribution

Self organized criticality has the following properties:

1. Individual events are statistically independent, both temporally and spatially

2. The size or occurence frequency distribution is scale-free, characterized by a power-law function.
